/*
PHYSICAL DS
ARRAY
  *Stored inside stack
  *Used when list of elements(size) is known
LINKED LIST
  *Stored inside Heap
  *Used when list of elements(size) is unkown
THESE TWO ARE PHYSICAL BZC THEY DEFINE HOW MEMORY SHOULD BE ORGANIZED FOR
STORING ELEMENTS or DATA

LOGICAL DATA STRUCTURE(UTILIZATION,INSERTION,DELETION OF ARRAY ARE PERFORMED
USING THE BELOW DS): *STACK *QUEUE *TREE *GRAPH *HASH TABLE

STACK & QUEUE -> LINEAR DS
TREE & GRAPH  -> NON-LINEAR DS
HASH TABLE    -> LINEAR OR TABULAR DS

STACK
 *Works on principle LAST IN FIRST OUT(LIFO)
QUEUE
 *Works on principle FIRST IN FIRST OUT(FIFO)

TREE
 *Organized like hierachy
GRAPH
 *collection of nodes and links
These DS are in application & algorithm

TO IMPLEMENT THESE LOGICAL DATA STRUCTURE ARE IMPLEMENTED USING PHYSICAL DATA
STRUCTURE(ARRAY AND LLIST)
