DATATYPE
  *Representation of Data   
  *Operation on Data
ABSTRACT
  *Hiding Internal Details
INTERNAL DETAILS are hidden while doing operation(Arithmetic & Logical Operation)
  *INTERNAL DETAILS ARE HIDDENT(+,-,*,Modulus)
  *This term is related to OOPS concept
LIST - 8,3,9,4,6,10,12

Data required for storing List:
  *SPACE (for Storing elements)
  *CAPACITY(Maximum capacity)
  *SIZE(Number of elements)

RESPRESENTATION OF LIST CAN BE DONE: 
 1.ARRAY   
 2.LINKED LIST

OPERATION ON LIST:
 1.ADD(x) or APPEND(x)  
 2.REMOVE(x) 
 3.SEARCH(X)   
 ......


ADT

REPRESENTATION OF DATA AND OPERARION ON THE DATA TOGETHER THEN IT BECOMES DATATYPE,BY HIDING DETAILS - ABSTRACT DATA TYPE

EXAMPLE IN OOPS - CLASS
  we define a class,declare variable and perform operation in it

LIST

1.add(element) or append(element)
2.add(index,element) or Insert(index,element)
3.remove(x)
4.set(index,new element) - Changing element at a given index
5.get(index) - Knowing an elements from a given index
6.search(key) - Searching for an element to finds its index if it is present in the index list
  * Also known as contains(key)
7.sort()
