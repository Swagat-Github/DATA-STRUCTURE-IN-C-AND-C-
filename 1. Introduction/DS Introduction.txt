/* 

SECTION OF STACK KNOWN AS FRAME OF MAIN FUNCTION or ACTIVATION RECORD OF MAIN FUNCTION
   Whatever the variales declared inside program or function,the MEMORY 
   for those variable will be created inside the STACK 
   
   So the portion of    memory given to the function is ACTIVATION 
   RECORD OF that function

STATIC MEMORY ALLOCATION(ORGANIZED MEMORY)
   Bytes of memory required by the function which was decide at compile 
   time is STATIC

HEAP - JUST PILLING UP IF THINGS ARE KEPT ONE ABOVER ANOTHER

  *Used of organized & Unorganized things 
  *Unorganized Memory    
  *Heap Memory must be used as resource when required(When require take 
  the memory or when you dont require release the memory)   
  *It cant be directly accessed(only Using Pointer) 
        int *p    
        p=new int[5] //C++ create array of 5 in heap memory   
        
        int *p  
        p=(int *)malloc(5*size of(int)) // C language

  * After acccessing(NO NEED OF MEMORY THEN DEALLOCATE)    
   
       delete[]p; // C++ Delete the Memory in HEAP MEMORY
       
       free(p); // C Delete the Memory in HEAP MEMORY

       P=NULL // Assign Pointer to NULL
  
  * If we aren't releasing memory in HEAP,then that memory will be still 
   belonging to that particular variable & that memory cant be used 
   again so it causes loss of memory known as MEMORY LEAK
